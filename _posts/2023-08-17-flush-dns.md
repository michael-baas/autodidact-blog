# How to Flush DNS

## Why is DNS flushing needed?

## How to Flush DNS: Windows
Open an Administrative Command Prompt and type the following command:

```ps

ipconfig /flushdns

```

## How to Flush DNS: MacOS
Open a terminal and execute the following command: 
```bash
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```
### What does this command do?
* **sudo** - Runs command as super user
* **killall** - Sends a signal to processes
* **-HUP** - Represents the 'HangUP' signal, which instructs the process to restart and re-read its configuration files. It's a way of telling the process to refresh itself without fully terminating it.
* **mDNSResponder** - The name can be broken down into "mDNS" (Multicast Domain Name System) and "Responder." Essentially, it's the service that responds to mDNS queries.  

#### What is mDNSResponder?

***mDNSResponder*** is a system service that runs on macOS and some other operating systems. Its primary function is to facilitate the use of DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) and mDNS (Multicast Domain Name System) protocols.  

***DNS-SD*** (DNS Service Discovery): DNS-SD is a way of using standard DNS programming interfaces, servers, and packet formats to browse the network for services. It's a way for devices and applications to advertise their services on a local network. When combined with mDNS, it allows for seamless service and device discovery without any centralized configuration or service.

On macOS, mDNSResponder handles both mDNS and regular unicast DNS requests. This service is essential for tasks like:  

* Helping your computer find printers on your local network.
* Discovering and connecting to other computers using Apple's "AirDrop" feature.
* Streaming audio and video to an Apple TV or other devices using "AirPlay."
* Other applications and services that rely on local network discovery.
