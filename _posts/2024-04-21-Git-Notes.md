## What are branches in Git and how do you use them?

Branches in git are basically pointers to a specific commit in the repositories history. They allow you to split off of the main branch, make changes such as bug fixes and new features without affecting the main branch.

One of the best illustrations I could find on this was from [codeinstitue.net](https://codeinstitute.net/global/blog/git-branches/) with the below image.

### How to Merge Branches

The first thing we need to do is to checkout the branch that we want to merge **into**.

```bash
# Checkout the branch you want to merge into
git checkout <branch-to-merge-into>
```

Next we can use the merge command to combine the branches

```bash
# Merge the branch with changes into the checked out branch
git merge <branch-to-merge>
```

Now we need to commit the merge

```bash
# Commit Merge
git commit -m "Merge branch <branch_to_merge> into <branch_to_merge_into>"
```
Finally, push the changes

```bash
git push
```
