## In simple words

Learning is easier when we switch between {% include term.html key='focused' text='focused thinking' %} and {% include term.html key='diffuse' text='relaxed thinking' %}. Focused thinking helps us pay attention to one small step. Relaxed thinking helps our brain make new connections in the background.

## Try this

- Set a 25â€‘minute timer (Pomodoro). Work on one small step.
- Take a 5â€‘minute break. Repeat.
