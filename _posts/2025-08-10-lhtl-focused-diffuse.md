## What you’ll do (why this matters)
You will learn the two thinking modes—**focused** and **diffuse**—and use a simple routine to switch between them on purpose. This helps you understand hard ideas, remember more, and solve problems with less stress.

## Words to know
- focused mode: narrow, deep attention on one task  
- diffuse mode: relaxed, broad thinking that links ideas  
- retrieval practice: recall from memory without looking  
- Pomodoro: 25-minute work, then a short break (time-boxing)

## What you need
- A timer (Windows **Clock**, macOS **Clock**, or **GNOME Clocks**)  
- Pen and paper (or a notes app)

## Steps
1) **Name one small target.**  
   Example: “Work 25 minutes on two practice problems.”

   ![GNOME Text Editor (blank note)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/GNOME%20Text%20Editor%20Screenshot.png)

2) **Set a 25-minute timer (one Pomodoro).**  
   - **Windows:** Clock → Timer → 25:00 → Start.  
   - **macOS:** Clock → Timers → 25:00 → Start.  
   - **Linux (GNOME):** Clocks → Timers → 25:00 → Start.

3) **Focus until the timer ends.**  
   Stay with the single task. If you get stuck, make a tiny mark in your notes and keep going.

4) **Take a 5-minute break (switch to diffuse mode).**  
   Walk, stretch, or do a simple chore. Let your mind wander (relaxed attention).

5) **Use retrieval practice.**  
   Without looking at notes, write what you can remember. Then fill gaps.

6) **Space your reviews.**  
   Review tomorrow, then a few days later. Keep reviews short (5–10 minutes).

7) **Verification step.**  
   You should be able to explain the idea in plain words and solve a similar problem without peeking.

## Common gotchas
- Long, nonstop “grind” → tunnel vision and slower progress. Use the 25/5 cycle to reset.  
- Only rereading notes → feels good but sticks poorly. Use **retrieval** (write from memory), then check.
